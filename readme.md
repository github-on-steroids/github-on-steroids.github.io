# Github on Steroids

we're making a suite of solutions to make the work of mentors, fellows (and other people who use github) in easy, when they are on github.

Since all fellows and mentors get into long discussions on github, work on wikis, write long issues, and editing large texts, few features are needed critically.The default github editor lacks these things like auto-indent, automatic addition of list dashes, brackets, styling shortcuts etc. So the chrome extension would replace the current editor with a powered up persion, with advanced features.

We plan to create a webapp so that different fellows (who have write access to the repository, done via github auth and api) can edit a single large text(wiki) at the same time, to fixup the error of "document has been updated since you last visited it" error.
